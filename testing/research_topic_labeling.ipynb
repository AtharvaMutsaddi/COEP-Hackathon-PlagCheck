            "Enter your research paper abstract: Memory attacks pose significant threats to the security and integrity of computer systems, exploiting vulnerabilities in the memory management mechanisms at the heart of modern computing architectures. This research paper offers a comprehensive examination of memory attacks in computer organization, encompassing various techniques such as buffer overflows, code injection, and side-channel attacks. Through an extensive review of literature and empirical studies, this paper elucidates the underlying principles and mechanisms behind memory attacks, exploring their implications for system security and reliability. Furthermore, this paper surveys existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies employed to defend against memory attacks, ranging from software-based techniques such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP) to hardware-level solutions including memory protection units (MPUs) and secure enclaves. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of these approaches, this research aims to provide insights into the ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience of computer systems against memory-based threats. Additionally, this paper discusses emerging trends and challenges in the field of memory security, including the impact of increasingly complex computing architectures and the evolution of attack vectors. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical importance of proactive measures in mitigating memory attacks and fostering a more secure computing environment in the face of evolving cyber threats.\n"

            "[[('Cybersecurity News, Threat Research, and more from the Team Spearheading the Evolution of Endpoint Security\\nDespite increasing investment in cybersecurity, cybercrime is surging. Every day attacks cripple healthcare providers, shut down educators, and disrupt financial/insurance services firms, manufacturing firms, law firms, and software companies to the point of risking closure. This is in large part because attacks have been changing, while defenses haven’t. Today’s malware increasingly executes runtime attacks in memory. According to Microsoft, 70 percent of the vulnerabilities in Microsoft products are memory safety issues. PurpleSec found that for 2022, memory corruption is now the most common type of zero-day exploit, making up 67.55 percent of attacks. For defenders relying on detection-based solutions for these types of attacks, this is a big problem.\\xa0\\n\\nNot so long ago, almost all malware relied on executables. Threat actors installed malicious software on disk in their victim\\'s environment. This malware would interact with infected machines or talk to a command and control (C2) server through function calls, system events, or messages.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, this malicious software leaves behind evidence of its existence, whether on a server or compromised endpoint. Defenders can rely on tools like endpoint protection platforms (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR/XDR), and antivirus (AV) to spot telltale signs of malware deployment. Finding these attack patterns and signatures is what cybersecurity technology evolved to do—detecting and isolating threats before they could do real damage. \\xa0\\nBut with attack chains now going in-memory, they offer little in the way of signatures to detect or behavior patterns to analyze. Traditional malware attacks haven\\'t gone away. It\\'s just that more threats are targeting device memory during runtime, to which traditional defenders have only limited visibility.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn-memory attacks can be installed with or without associated files, and work in the space between when an end user starts an application and turns it off. Runtime attacks like Emotet, Jupyter, Cobalt Strike, and supply chain attacks can move around inside a victim\\'s environment.\\xa0\\n \\nThese threats don\\'t typically leave a recognizable imprint on a device disk. Evidence of these threats can eventually appear as alerts on a signature-based solution. This includes security information and event management (SIEM) or security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions. But by then it\\'s usually too late for defenders to do anything.\\xa0\\nStealthy and powerful, application runtime attacks lay the ground for ransomware deployment and data exfiltration.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a feature of fileless malware, complete in-memory attack chains first started appearing in the mid-2010s. The notorious Angler Exploit Kit, known for its unique obfuscation, empowered cybercriminals to exploit web browser vulnerabilities for a monthly fee. In 2015 alone, cybercriminals using Angler stole and extorted $34 million from their victims. \\xa0\\nIn recent years, memory compromises have surged. Threat actors are using tools like Cobalt Strike—a legitimate pentesting solution—to maliciously load a communications beacon from device memory. Between 2019 and 2020, cyberattacks using Cobalt Strike increased by 161 percent. It\\'s commonly used by Conti, the most successful ransomware group in operation today, pulling in $180 million in revenue in 2021. \\n \\nTo evade traditional signature and behavior-focused security solutions, threat actors now create malware that targets runtime in-memory and hijacks legitimate processes. Picus Labs’ 2021 Red Report mapped over 200,000 malware files to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They found three of the five most prevalent attack methods last year happened in-memory.” \\xa0\\nMemory compromise is now a typical feature of attack chains like that preceding Ireland’s national health service breach in 2021.\\xa0\\nWhat happens in device memory during an application\\'s runtime is mostly invisible to defenders. To understand why, think about how a solution might try and scan an application while someone is using it.\\xa0\\xa0\\nA solution would have to 1) scan device memory multiple times during the lifetime of the application while 2) listening to the correct triggering operations and 3) find malicious patterns to catch an attack in progress. The biggest obstacle to doing these three things is scale. In a typical application\\'s runtime environment, there might be 4GB of virtual memory. It\\'s not possible to scan this volume of data frequently enough, at least not without slowing down the application so much as to make it unusable. So a memory scanner can only look at specific memory regions, at specific timeline triggers, for very specific parameters—all assuming the memory state is stable and consistent. \\xa0\\n \\nWith such a limited scope, a memory scanning-focused solution might, in a best-case scenario, see between three to four percent of application memory. But threats increasingly use polymorphism to obfuscate their presence, even in-memory. This means catching malicious activity in such a small sample of device memory would be miraculous. Compounding this problem, attacks now bypass or tamper with the hooks most solutions use to spot attacks in progress.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0Unsurprisingly, remote access trojans (RATs), infostealers, and loaders now use application memory to hide for extended periods of time. The average time an attacker lingers in a network is around 11 days. For advanced threats like RATs and info stealers, this figure is closer to 45 days.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn memory compromise is not a single type of threat. Instead, it\\'s a feature of attack chains leading to a wide range of outcomes. For example, ransomware is not necessarily associated with memory runtime attacks. But to deploy ransomware, threat actors usually must infiltrate networks and escalate privileges.

            "[[('Cybersecurity News, Threat Research, and more from the Team Spearheading the Evolution of Endpoint Security\\nDespite increasing investment in cybersecurity, cybercrime is surging. Every day attacks cripple healthcare providers, shut down educators, and disrupt financial/insurance services firms, manufacturing firms, law firms, and software companies to the point of risking closure. This is in large part because attacks have been changing, while defenses haven’t. Today’s malware increasingly executes runtime attacks in memory. According to Microsoft, 70 percent of the vulnerabilities in Microsoft products are memory safety issues. PurpleSec found that for 2022, memory corruption is now the most common type of zero-day exploit, making up 67.55 percent of attacks. For defenders relying on detection-based solutions for these types of attacks, this is a big problem.\\xa0\\n\\nNot so long ago, almost all malware relied on executables. Threat actors installed malicious software on disk in their victim\\'s environment. This malware would interact with infected machines or talk to a command and control (C2) server through function calls, system events, or messages.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, this malicious software leaves behind evidence of its existence, whether on a server or compromised endpoint. Defenders can rely on tools like endpoint protection platforms (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR/XDR), and antivirus (AV) to spot telltale signs of malware deployment. Finding these attack patterns and signatures is what cybersecurity technology evolved to do—detecting and isolating threats before they could do real damage. \\xa0\\nBut with attack chains now going in-memory, they offer little in the way of signatures to detect or behavior patterns to analyze. Traditional malware attacks haven\\'t gone away. It\\'s just that more threats are targeting device memory during runtime, to which traditional defenders have only limited visibility.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn-memory attacks can be installed with or without associated files, and work in the space between when an end user starts an application and turns it off. Runtime attacks like Emotet, Jupyter, Cobalt Strike, and supply chain attacks can move around inside a victim\\'s environment.\\xa0\\n \\nThese threats don\\'t typically leave a recognizable imprint on a device disk. Evidence of these threats can eventually appear as alerts on a signature-based solution. This includes security information and event management (SIEM) or security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions. But by then it\\'s usually too late for defenders to do anything.\\xa0\\nStealthy and powerful, application runtime attacks lay the ground for ransomware deployment and data exfiltration.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a feature of fileless malware, complete in-memory attack chains first started appearing in the mid-2010s. The notorious Angler Exploit Kit, known for its unique obfuscation, empowered cybercriminals to exploit web browser vulnerabilities for a monthly fee. In 2015 alone, cybercriminals using Angler stole and extorted $34 million from their victims. \\xa0\\nIn recent years, memory compromises have surged. Threat actors are using tools like Cobalt Strike—a legitimate pentesting solution—to maliciously load a communications beacon from device memory. Between 2019 and 2020, cyberattacks using Cobalt Strike increased by 161 percent. It\\'s commonly used by Conti, the most successful ransomware group in operation today, pulling in $180 million in revenue in 2021. \\n \\nTo evade traditional signature and behavior-focused security solutions, threat actors now create malware that targets runtime in-memory and hijacks legitimate processes. Picus Labs’ 2021 Red Report mapped over 200,000 malware files to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They found three of the five most prevalent attack methods last year happened in-memory.” \\xa0\\nMemory compromise is now a typical feature of attack chains like that preceding Ireland’s national health service breach in 2021.\\xa0\\nWhat happens in device memory during an application\\'s runtime is mostly invisible to defenders. To understand why, think about how a solution might try and scan an application while someone is using it.\\xa0\\xa0\\nA solution would have to 1) scan device memory multiple times during the lifetime of the application while 2) listening to the correct triggering operations and 3) find malicious patterns to catch an attack in progress. The biggest obstacle to doing these three things is scale. In a typical application\\'s runtime environment, there might be 4GB of virtual memory. It\\'s not possible to scan this volume of data frequently enough, at least not without slowing down the application so much as to make it unusable. So a memory scanner can only look at specific memory regions, at specific timeline triggers, for very specific parameters—all assuming the memory state is stable and consistent. \\xa0\\n \\nWith such a limited scope, a memory scanning-focused solution might, in a best-case scenario, see between three to four percent of application memory. But threats increasingly use polymorphism to obfuscate their presence, even in-memory. This means catching malicious activity in such a small sample of device memory would be miraculous. Compounding this problem, attacks now bypass or tamper with the hooks most solutions use to spot attacks in progress.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0Unsurprisingly, remote access trojans (RATs), infostealers, and loaders now use application memory to hide for extended periods of time. The average time an attacker lingers in a network is around 11 days. For advanced threats like RATs and info stealers, this figure is closer to 45 days.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn memory compromise is not a single type of threat. Instead, it\\'s a feature of attack chains leading to a wide range of outcomes. For example, ransomware is not necessarily associated with memory runtime attacks. But to deploy ransomware, threat actors usually must infiltrate networks and escalate privileges. These processes tend to happen in memory at runtime. \\xa0\\n \\nThe standard approach to cybersecurity is to detect attacks in progress or after being breached. This puts every type of organization and IT asset at risk from \"invisible\" runtime attacks. Morphisec’s incident response team has seen in-memory compromise used in situations ranging from servers in financial institutions to endpoints in hospitals and everything in between. \\xa0\\nThese threats don’t just target memory processes on Windows servers and devices.
